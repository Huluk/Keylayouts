Here are my Forks of the Neo-Layout for Mac.
Originals: http://neo-layout.org

Instructions:
1. Put the `.keylayout` files and the corresponding `.icns` in `~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/`.
2. Select Keyboards in Language & Text Preferences.
Optional:
3. Use the modified `private.xml` in `Neo/` in KeyRemap4Mac for better Mod3 access.

Arab_Neo:
In the standard version, arabic is used when caps lock is active.
The characters are on the layer `caps` and the additional layer `shift caps`.
The version `Arab_Neo/neo lars arabic.keylayout`
is an older version with latin letters on the caps layer.

Numbers on the Keypad are european arabic numbers,
the normal arabic layer uses standard arabic numbers
and shift arabic are eastern arabic numbers.
